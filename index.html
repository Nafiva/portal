    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Nafiva Jeza, I am an emerging professional focusing on AI software engineering at Year up. 
      I am trilingual including reading and writing in all three languages. </p>
      
      <p>This will allow me to easily communicate during collaborations and team settings with people from 
        any and all backgrounds.</p> 

      <p>I take pride in my communication, critical thinking and adaptability skills. Considering Tech is a 
        consistently growing industry, my adaptability skills will allow me to stay on top of new programming 
        languages and tech trends such as AI.</p>

        <p>My previous job experiences would also serve a purpose in improving efficiency in the tech field. 
          Some of my responsibilities included maintaining clear communication with clients throughout projects.
          Developing and executing creative concepts for projects that meet their specific goals. Helping the
          client reach their target audience and maximize their profit with data collection and analysis.
          Anticipating potential problems and implementing proactive measures to prevent them and so on. </p>

          <p>Therefore, having me on your team will be mutually beneficial, allowing me to share my high value 
            and set of skills. With that being said, my goal is to break into the tech industry as an AI engineer,
